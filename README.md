# Haught Codeworks Team Guide

This is our collection of thoughts on how we go about being a team and performing the work of developing software.  We've gathered from various sources to create this collection. In particular, we'd like to thank Thoughtbot for making their (Playbook)[https://playbook.thoughtbot.com] available for other teams to reference and draw from. It's a valuable collection of resources. We adopted from the playbook in creating our own documents. You are free to take inspiration from any and all that we've outlined here to make your team better.
