# Notes
(Probably want to restructure. Order might be important. Higher level dynamics that go into it.)

Standups: Touch on the personal. People feel comfortable and can trust teammates. Best interests at heart. Connect to people as they are. Feel more of a connection to us as people! Understand we're all different in some fashions, but build on common ground in how we're alike. Nice sense of diversity though. Encourages people to be more respectful since we share personally. Be more careful about how we're critical or give feedback. No shame or blame, but there is accountability. "the reason we touch on personal elements is so the entire team knows more about each other and feels more of a connection to each of us as people."-Marty

Team Chat: mention each project has own hangout link for things that go beyond(I did this, but mention earlier on??) We have an internal set of rooms that we use as a team, and a set of rooms that we use for external client chatting that the client is part of. Internally we can discuss without fear or judgement of how a client will react to honest opinions on things. Nice that these are on two separate platforms. It's important that while we stay connected, we don't want it to become too distracting. Make sure we hear from team members each day so they don't become isolated, especially if they're working solo on a project. Feel a part of the team each week. Use the general room for interesting things you're seeing or small stories without making it joke central all the time. Project rooms stay higher signal that way.

Weekly Client Calls (ADD): check in with clients each week on project specific video conferences. Purpose: so team and client can stay in sync on regular basis. Cover what work was done, what we're planning to do and if anything needs to change. It's about feedback. What client wants and if something didn't work for them. Meetings are usually pretty quick and important they don't drag on. So team can move forward and client can know what's happening. Also maybe mention we have a standing video conference to be used internally or impromptu client discussions if needed.

Email: Used for sending larger updates on functionality if we have client questions outside of weekly calls. Strngth is everyone has it and great for async communication that could take days to resolve. Also better at referencing results after the fact (search for projects, etc.)

Planning Tool: capture requirement and details about featrues or bugs. Vital that whatever is settled on in teamchat, winds up on board for future reference. Team chat is bad at looking things up or referenign later.


# Team Communication

We are a small remote team and, although we don't spend our time in a physical office, we are regularly in touch throughout the day and we enjoy working together. We have found the following tools and practices help us facilitate successful communication and collaboration.

## Weekly Standups

Every Monday, our team starts the week with a video conference. This gives us a chance to see everyone's faces and hear from each member of the team. Everyone shares what they have been working on over the past week, what was completed, and what they're planning to work on in the coming week. In addition to sharing work related information, we enjoy taking time to hear a little about what everyone is up to personally.

## Team Chat

In addition to using chat apps to communicate with clients, we use team chat in a variety of ways internally. Our team chat has work related and social value, and we use different channels for different purposes and projects.

All team members belong to our general channel, and this is where we discuss internal issues relevant to all of us, say hello to each other, and have informal, non project specific conversations during the day. It's like our water cooler. We also have a channel for each project where we can share ideas and discuss strategies. This prevents project specific chat from taking over our general channel and helps us to focus on each project separately. Rather than feeling the pressure to check a message as soon as it comes in, we're able to visit a channel throughout the day and scroll through it to track a conversation.

We find that team chat is a great place for quick questions or comments and small conversations. Most of our channels contain links to video conferences when we feel the need for a face to face conversation, a screen share, or a more in-depth discussion amongst team members.

## Video Conferences

Sometimes team chat doesn't cut it and you need face to face. This is the reason all of our team chat channels have an associated video conference that we can hop into when a discussion is needed. We use them for team check-in's on project progress, particularly when there's a question about code or process. We're able to easily share our screens, look at each other's work, and provide feedback and ideas. This is also a great way for senior developers to mentor those on the team who are more junior. Rather than waiting to review code when a pull request comes in, we have the opportunity to touch base in the moment when we have a question or need support from a team member.

## Email

* Unclear on this. What would you say are our main purposes/ uses of email?

## Web Task Board

We use online project boards to manage our progress on projects and to keep track of what everyone is working on. We are able to break projects into small tasks, assign ourselves to a task, leave comments and checklists regarding our work, and see at a glance the status of each task. Check out our related document on (task boards and cards)[https://github.com/HaughtCodeworks/TeamGuide] for more on how we use this system.
