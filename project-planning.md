# Project Planning Meeting Overview Guide

Start the weekly project planning meetings by asking the client if there is anything new in the business that we should cover before we review the board. This discussion should be limited to significant changes or updates to the project that the team may not already be aware of.  We want to limit the length of the discussion so that we more deeply cover items as cards at the appropriate time in the meeting. This lets the client update us on any important news to the team but not take up too much of the meeting on covering in-depth status on all business matters for the client.

Go over cards that are completed in each stage, starting with production and proceeding through the different environments the project uses for its lifecycle.
For each card we want to cover the following:
  * Discuss with the client what's happened since our last meeting.
  * Bring up anything interesting or out of the ordinary related to the card.
  * If the card is blocked, discuss the nature of that and identify what the team needs to get the card moving again.
  * If the card is awaiting review or needs verification, identify what is needed and make sure the client knows if there's anything we need from them.
  * Review any questions or concerns the client may have, and resolve them as appropriate.
  * If there are issues or additional action items, identify them and determine if the card needs to return to an earlier stage of the workflow or if new cards are created as follow ups.

Review any cards under development with a short status update on each one. Though we want to keep this step brief, we do want to know if anything has changed on these cards.

Review any cards that haven't been previously discussed or may have changed since our last meeting. The [Developer Workflow](/HaughtCodeworks/TeamGuide/blob/master/developer_workflow.md) has a detailed section titled Card Review that has a thorough list of elements to be discussed.

Ask if there are any new cards that should be added to the board. If so, add them and review them in detail according to the [Developer Workflow](/HaughtCodeworks/TeamGuide/blob/master/developer_workflow.md).

Ask the client if all cards are ordered in priority with highest priority being listed at top.  If not, ask how they should be adjusted.  Determine if any cards should be postponed for another time.

Close the meeting by asking if there's anything else that should be covered.
